      <span className="about-title">About Me</span>
      <p className="about-text1">
        I'm a recent Software Engineering graduate from McGill University, with
        a solid foundation in full-stack development and a passion for creating
        efficient, accessible, and user-focused solution. With hands-on
        experience in React, Spring Boot, and database management, I've
        developed projects ranging from budget management applications to
        assistive navigation systems for the visually impaired. My approach to
        software engineering emphasizes problem-solving, adaptability, and
        continuously refining my skills to meet real-world challenges.

      <p className="about-text2">
        During my internship at Ciena Corporation, I built a responsive budget
        management app that streamlined data entry by 40% and enhanced data
        security through role-based access control. Additionally, my capstone
        project — a vision-guided navigation assistance app — demonstrated my
        commitment to building inclusive technology by providing real-time
        feedback to visually impaired users in urban settings.
      </p>
      <p className="about-text3">
        I'm excited to apply my skills to a dynamic team where I can contribute
        to impactful projects, learn from experienced mentors, and further
        develop as a software engineer. Whether it's optimizing workflows,
        enhancing user experience, or building from the ground up, I'm ready to
        tackle the challenges ahead.
